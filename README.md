# READMEsite

**readmesite** is static site generator, that turns the `README.md` of any repository into a standalone website; no files, configs or flags, just the command builds the site.

It converts a git repository's `README.md` file into a clean, single-page static website. It's designed to be zero-configuration for the target repository and generates sites that are easy to deploy.


## Usage

To use `readmesite`, run the command:

```bash
npx -y readmesite
```

That's all! Just running the command will create your standalone website.

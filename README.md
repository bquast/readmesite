# READMEsite

**READMEsite** is static site generator, that turns the `README.md` of any repository into a standalone website;
no files, configs or flags, just the command builds the site.

It converts a git repository's `README.md` file into a clean, single-page static website.
It's designed to be zero-configuration for the target repository and generates sites that are easy to deploy.


## Usage

To use `readmesite`, run it using [npx](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npx):

```bash
npx readmesite
```

That's all! Just running that command will create your standalone website.
By default it will be placed in the same directory (the project folder).

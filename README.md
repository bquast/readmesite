# READMEsite

**readmesite** is a simple command-line interface (CLI) tool that converts a git repository's `README.md` file into a clean, single-page static website. It's designed to be zero-configuration for the target repository and generates sites that are easy to deploy.

# The Problem
You have a great `README.md` on your git repository that explains your project well. You want a quick and easy way to turn this existing documentation into a standalone webpage without setting up complex static site generators or needing to add configuration files to your project repository.

## The Solution
*readmesite* fetches your `README.md` directly from the git repo, converts it to HTML, applies some basic styling, and outputs a self-contained static site (an `index.html` and a `style.css`) ready for deployment.

## Features
-   **zero-Config for Target Repo:** No need to add any files or conffâ€¢guration to the repository whose README you want to convert.
-   **Simple CLI:** Easy-to-use command-line interface.
-   **GitHub Integration:** Fetches READMEs directly from public GitHub repositories (tries `main` and then `master` branches).
-   **Markdown Conversion:** Uses `marked` to convert Markdown to HTML.
-   **Basic Styling:** Includes a clean, readable default stylesheet.

## Installation

You can install `readmesite` globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g readmesite
```   

Alternatively, you can use it directly with `npx` without a global installation:
```bash
npx readmesite <args>
```    

## Usage

To use `readmesite`, run the command followed by the repository URL or identifier:

```bash
readmesite <URL>
```

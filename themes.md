# Themes

## Usage

READMEsite supports themes using the `--theme` flag, followed by the `themename` as listed on the [READMEsite Theme Store](https://store.readme.site), for instance:

    npx readmesite --theme darkmode

## Structure

Themes consist of at least a CSS file of the form `[themename].css`, e.g. `darkmode.css`. In addition the theme can provide a HTML template as `[themename].html`, e.g. `darkmode.html`.


## Contributing to the Store

Themes can be added to the READMEsite Theme Store, by submitting a pull request to the Store repository
